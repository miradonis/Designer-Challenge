        <h2>Every idea starts with a need</h2>
        <article>
            <p class="text">
                Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more
                customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on
                my cell phone,
                I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that
                many designers
                (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
                the result was
                just something nice and did not solve any problem.

                After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot

            <h3 class="bold">Start with asking</h3>
            <p>
                Why You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more effective ways of achieving
                goals.
            </p>
            <h3 class="bold">Your ideas will have more value</h3>
            <p>
                By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.
            </p>
            <h3 class="bold">Design solutions with love</h3>
            <p>
                Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and
                resolve
                to end it.
            </p>
            <h3 class="bold">Share and show your work</h3>
            <p>
                As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You
                will
                learn to accept
                feedback and learn from it.
